In this folder contains my project to create 5 pages of web pages using HTML, CSS, and BootStrap 5.
To get the nav-bar up top I saw the tutorial and followed it. To create it you must place the links in a ul.




My 5 webpages are:

- Home.html
- Stores.html
- Reviews.html, contains a link to the NewsPaperReview.html
- NewsPaperReview.html, contains a fictional review and some real news that has happened recently. \
  Is linked through the "Reviews.html" file.
- signup.html
