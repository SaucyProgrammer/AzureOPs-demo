        <hr>
        <p>So what "secret" does Virginia's highest net revenue mall ,estimated at 1 billion dollars 2013, have to
            offer.
            A simple answer, coffee. At <i>"Zak's Coffee Shop"</i>. At this mid sized-family owned Afghan Coffee shop
            you find
            a variety of drinks, from North America and some blends and style from the Exotic Afghanistan. The taste,
            the smell, the aromatization
            you'll feel inside the store will last with you and your generations for 1000 life-lines. How often do you
            go to the mall and walk by
            this subtly "Wonder of the World"? When I first met Zak, he was a charismatic, friendly store owner. He
            immediately sat me down and brought me
            cake pops, drinks, a sandwich and anything else you can think of! All of his employees came to me and said
            hello as well.
            After meeting Zak and his employees I had to ask him "Why a coffee shop"? He answered, "He wanted to be
            different and not own a dealership but a
            coffee shop". From meeting Zak first hand he had a certain presence to him, it looked as if he was kind and
            warm hearted but cautious,
            understandable, he did not know he was gonna be interviewed in the middle of the day.

                    <p>Mr Johnson's visit to Kyiv was not announced in advance and the first indication he was in the
                        city came when a photograph of his meeting with President Zelensky was put on Twitter by the
                        Ukrainian embassy in London.

                        A Downing Street spokesman said: "The prime minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President
                        Zelensky in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people."

                    <p>In a statement after the meeting, Mr Johnson paid tribute to "President Zelensky's resolute

                        defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv".

                        He said: "I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this
                        ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run.

                        "We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to
                        bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign
                        nation."</p>

                    <h5>Florida visitor from UK wanted to catch a shark. Instead he caught something amazing</h5>
                    <sub>April 10,2022. 4:39 pm EST</sub>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        When Ian Atherton traveled across the pond from his home in Fleetwood, England to Florida's
                        Space Coast for an April vacation, one of the things he had on his bucket list was to catch a
                        shark. He had always envisioned what it would be like to tangle man-to-fish with one of the
                        ocean's most fearsome apex predators.

                        How's that saying go about best laid plans?

                        Atherton was able to catch and release a giant seagoing fish, only it wasn't a shark, but a
                        distant cousin and something much rarer — and some might say cooler — than a shark.</p>

                    <sub><i>Pictured here is a saw-fish</i></sub>
                    <br>
                    <p>The fish uses it in the wild by swinging it back and forth through a school of small baitfish. A
                        whack from the saw will stun a small fish allowing the sawfish to pick it up from the bottom
                        since it mouth is located on the underside of the large fish. They also eat crustaceans and
                        other bottom dwelling organisms.
